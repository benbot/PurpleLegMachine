# LegDay

This controls a custom exo-leg by sending serial signals from a raspberry pi to 
and arduino with a motor control shield attached.

TODO: Base next motion set off inputs from a gyroscope and an accelerometer

## Where does what?

The `Actuator` module controls the actual leg movement

This was made in 36 hours for MedHacks 2016. :)
